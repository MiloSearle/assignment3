                <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
                <h2>The Nature of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that allows web developers to implement features on web pages such as interactive maps, animated 2D or 3D graphics, etc. 
                    JavaScript is a functional and object-oriented language. Functional programming is features such as first-class functions and arrays and object-oriented programming
                    are features such as objects which users can interact with such as buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>Objects and Methods in JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Objects in JavaScript are key/value pairs in which are properties and methods and have other JavaScript data types within them such as strings, numbers and Booleans.
                    Objects originate from the parent Object constructor. This makes working with individual objects very easy and simple from the built-in methods that come with it such 
                    as Object.create(), Object.keys(), Object.values() and many more.
                </p>
                <h2>Event Handling in JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Event handling is JavaScript is used handle to when the state of an object is changing. This can be caused by user inputs, user actions and browser actions. 
                    Examples of this would be clicking on button or a mouse which can change the state of an object or go to a new page completely. You can code JavaScript so it 
                    executes when an event is detected such as a button being clicked. 
                </p>
