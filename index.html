                <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
                <h2>The Nature of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that allows web developers to implement features on web pages such as interactive maps, animated 2D or 3D graphics, etc. 
                    JavaScript is a functional and object-oriented language. Functional programming is features such as first-class functions and arrays and object-oriented programming
                    are features such as objects which users can interact with such as buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>Objects and Methods in JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Objects in JavaScript are key/value pairs in which are properties and methods and have other JavaScript data types within them such as strings, numbers and Booleans.
                    Objects originate from the parent Object constructor. This makes working with individual objects very easy and simple from the built-in methods that come with it such 
                    as Object.create(), Object.keys(), Object.values() and many more.
                </p>
                <h2>Event Handling in JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Event handling is JavaScript is used handle to when the state of an object is changing. This can be caused by user inputs, user actions and browser actions. 
                    Examples of this would be clicking on button or a mouse which can change the state of an object or go to a new page completely. You can code JavaScript so it 
                    executes when an event is detected such as a button being clicked. 
                </p>
                <h2>Security Issues with JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript has extreme security issues which can be very damaging. Exploiting JavaScript can lead to hackers manipulating data, redirect sessions, modify and steal data.
                    There are ways to prevent these security issues, the first way is to avoid using eval(), eval() executes a passed argument if it is JavaScript code or expression meaning 
                    that the hacker will be able to run any code or script that they want to. Another way to increase security is to use encryption such HTTPS which encrypts data which is 
                    transmitted between the client and the server meaning that it will be extremely hard to intercept.
                </p>
                <h2>Access Methods in JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Object methods can be accessed in JavaScript to be able to use it. In order to access a method, this line of code must be used - objectName.methodName(). This will then allow 
                    web developers to use the objects in areas of their webpage and then display them such as prompt boxes, alerts, confirmations etc.
                </p>
                <h2>Examples of JavaScript</h2>
                <h3>Alert, Confirm and Prompt Boxes</h3>
                <p>The button below will make an alert box appear.</p>
                <button onclick="myAlertBox()">Click me!</button>
                <p>An alert box aids functionality to a website as it can act as a warning to users that click on the button and make sure if this was their intention.</p>
                <p>The button below will bring up a confirm box.</p>
                <button onclick="myConfirmBox()">Click me!</button>
                <p id = "democonfirm"></p>
                <p>A confirm box aids functionality to a website the same way an alert box does as it ensures that the user does want to complete this action.</p>
                <p>The button below will bring up a prompt box.</p>
                <button onclick="myPromptBox()">Click me!</button>
                <p id="demoprompt"></p>
                <p>A prompt box aids functionality to a website as if the website requires information or a certain input to perform an action, then the user can input it in a prompt box.</p>
                <h3>Creating Cookies</h3>
                <p>This webpage has cookies on it as in the beginning it asks the user for their name with a prompt box. When the user enters their name they can access the webpage and when the
                    user returns to the webpage, this is because when the user entered their name, it was stored in a cookie.
                </p>
                <p>Cookies aids functionality to a website by storing user information which can lead to recommended advertisements and store information which they have entered before so they don't have to remember it.</p>
                <h3>Form Input Validation</h3>
                <p>Below is an example of a form input with a prompt on what to input:</p>
                <p>Please enter a number between 1 and 10:</p>
                <input id="num">
                <button type="button" onclick="myFormInput()">Submit</button>
                <p id="demoform"></p>
                <p>Form input validation aids functionality to a website because if a user enters information which is not valid, instead of it just breaking the website, it comes up with the message telling the user if it is a valid input or not.</p>
                <h1>Issues Surrounding Cross Browser Compatibility</h1>
                <p>The first issue that comes up is that people don't test on real devices first. Testing on devices is a very helpful way to make sure that your code does work on different browsers and if not, you can identify the different areas on 
                    the website which aren't working easily as it is your website and you know where the code is. </p>
                <p>Another issue that comes up is that people do not validate their code for their website. Some browsers can handle code which isn't validated such as Google Chrome which can just auto-correct problems but browsers like Internet Explorer 
                    don't have an auto-correct feature and either the website will crash or the will just disregard the feature which isn't validated and not display it.</p>
                <p>Vendor-specific functions is another issue that developers want to avoid as these can cause CSS to only work on certain browsers. Prefixes can cause it as well such as -webkit which is for Safari and Chrome, -ms which is for Internet Explorer, 
                    -moz which is for Mozilla Firefox and -o which is for Opera. These prefixes causes the function to only work in that browser which is something a developer doesn't want if they want it cross-browser compatible.</p>
                <p>One of the best ways to see if certain features are compatible on a browser is the website <a href = "https://caniuse.com/">CanIUse</a> as it shows users what feature you want to see and shows you what browsers it works on and what versions of
                    that browser it works on. Below is an example of how it works: </p>
                <img src = "caniuse example.PNG" alt = "CanIUse example">
                <p>As you can see, its shows a specific feature, in this example CSS Grid Layout, a description of the feature and shows all the browsers and the versions that don't and do work. In the tabs below, it has notes which can show fixes for it if you may
                    be wondering why a feature is not working, for example it says for note number 3 "Enabled in FireFox through layout.css.grid.enabled" to enable the feature. The resources tab is the most useful in the website as it provides fixes for features that
                    aren't compatible such as polyfill.
                <p>Polyfill is used in JavaScript which allows you to use features in older browsers and older versions of browsers that would work in newer browsers. This means that users that use older versions of a browser or an old browser can now see features which 
                    they normally wouldn't be able to see, creating a wider audience to your website. An example of some code which can be fixed is the Math.trunc(n) function which rounds a decimal number to a whole number. This function works in newer browsers but not older browsers.
                    In order to allow it to work in older browsers, you need to declare the missing function in the code. Here is the code:</p>
                <img src = "polyfill code example.PNG" alt = "Polyfill Code Example"> 
                </p>
                <h1>Client Issues with a Website's Performance</h1>
                <h2>User's Choice of Device</h2>
                <p>A user's choice of device can affect website performance and its features as different devices have different limits meaning that if someone runs a website on a high-end PC compared to a phone, the PC is going to be able to load and run the website 
                    much better than the phone as the phone will have hardware which isn't as good as the PC. Features and information may disply differently on a device that the website wasn't intended or considered for which may lead to confusion on the user's end as 
                    their might be an image or an object which isn't in its intented place and will look out of place.</p>
                <h2>User's Choice of Web Browser</h2>
                <p>The browser that the user is using may affect load times and compatiblity of code depending how old the browser is and what browser it is. If the code is not compatible with the browser, then the features or objects that the browser isn't compatible with 
                    will either not be seen or will not allow the website or page to be loaded at all and will come up with an error. An example would be older versions of Internet Explorer as some older versions cannot display RGB.</p>
                <h1>Server Issues with a Website's Performance</h1>
                <h2>Web Server Capacity</h2>
                <p>A web server can only hold so much data and even if the limit isn't reached, if the website is a good size then loading times will still be slow with the website which may cause users to not visit the website as long loading times can be very annoying. 
                    A fix for this could be removing unnecessary code in the website by validating it or by just identifying features that may just not be needed.</p>
                <h2>Available Bandwidth</h2>
                <p>The available bandwidth of the website will limit the bandwidth of the user meaning that the user will not be getting the load times that they would be expecting.</p>
                <h2>Executions to be Performed Before Page Loads</h2>
                <p>Depending on the amount of executions to be performed before a page loads, the load times may be slow as it has to possibly perform multiple executions and will take a bit to load up, if there are too many executions, the website might come up with an error as it would be just overloaded.</p>
                <h1>Importance of Website Security</h1>
                <h2>Forms of Virus</h2>
                <h3>Trojans</h3>
                <p>A Trojan virus is malware which disguises itself to be something else or perform something else but its true intent is to install malware onto the user's hardware, similar to the Trojan horse that snuck trojans into the city of Troy, which is why it is called a Trojan horse virus or Trojan virus.
                    A way to protect your device from a Trojan virus is by installing an anti-virus against it, the anti-virus will scan frequently and effeciently to detect and alert you if a Trojan Virus is detected.
                </p>
                <h3>Worms</h3>
                <p>A worm virus is a program that can duplicate itself and spread through a network on its own and without the user needing to do something other downloading the malicous program itself. It is most commonly transmitted with file-sharing networks and emails. As Worms normally infiltrate from network 
                    services, a personal firewall would be a good solution to them as it will block external access to the network services and will prevent the worm from entering the system.</p>
                <h2>Hacking</h2>
                <p>Hacking is when an unauthorised user gains access into a system or network through a breach or cracking passwords and codes which allows access to the network. The best way to defend your system or network from hackers is with encryption as encryption encrypts data as it is moving through a network 
                    which makes the job very hard for a hacker to intercept as it will take much longer to access and find the access code to the encryption. If the hacker is identified accuractly, they can also be prosecuted with the Computer Misuse Act (1990) which defends personal data held by organisations from hackers. 
                    If a hacker goes against this act, the maximum penalty is up to 10 years in prison or an unlimited fine.</p>
                <h2>Identity Theft</h2>
                <h3>Driver's License Fraud</h3>
                <p>Driver's license fraud is when someone has a driver's license given to them but under someone elses name so that any violations made on the road is on someone elses record and not theirs which could then end up on that person losing their license from doing nothing wrong. The main ways identity theft happens is from 
                    theft, phishing, cold calling and hacking. To prevent theft, you could have an alarm or CCTV around your home to identify who the theif is and also deter them if the alarm goes off. Phishing can be prevented by being cautious and knowing who you are being contacted by which can be done by checking their email address
                     and if what they asking would actually be needed. Cold calling is when someone may pretend to be an organisation to gain your personal information, this can be prevented by just ignoring any unsolicited calls and assume every one has intention of gaining your personal information.</p>
                <h3>Financial Identity Theft</h3>
                <p>Financial identity theft is when someone uses your personal information to access things such as bank accounts. This type of fraud can take a very long time to recover from and can lead to debt and a bad credit score. The most common way this happens is through theft of someones wallet or purse, the best way to prevent 
                    this is to freeze all of your bank accounts and contact your bank immediately to fix the problem.</p>
                <h3>Child Identity Theft</h3>
                <p>Child identity theft is normally committed by a relative or a close family friend who takes out loans and credit cards in the child's name which the child will not notice as they don't need monitor their credit score and reports and will not notice until they come of age. Similar to financial identity fraud, this can take
                    a long time to sort out and can come with some long term issues.</p>
                <h3>Change of Address Fraud</h3>
                <p>Change of address fraud is when someone changes your mailing address to divert information such as bank details and credit card details towards them which they can then steal and use for personal gain. This would be done through either phishing or cold calling so ignore out of place emails and ignore unsolicited calls.</p>
                <h3>Employment Identity Theft</h3>
                <p>Criminals, illegal immigrants and the unemployed can pretend to be you and gain employment through this as they are using your history in jobs and society and not theirs. This will most likely happen from theft as it requires identification and will be a face-to-face interview so in order to prevent this, home security needs 
                    to be put into place in order to deter theives from your home.</p>
                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>The legislation that prosecutes organisations if a data breach occurs and is being shared is The Data Protection Act which controls how customer and personal data is used within an organisation and government bodies. A real world example of this being breached is when NHS files got into the wrong hands and a data breach happened 
                    for patients where their personal information was revealed which meant the NHS had to pay a lot of money as a consequence.</p>
                <h3>Methods for Protecting Data</h3>
                <p>One method for protecting data would be encryption. If data is encrypted, then it will be very hard to be accessed by hackers as the information to access the data will be disguised and hard to identify making it very annoying and will cause them to eventually give up if they quit easily but some hackers will be quite dedicated and 
                    may continue to try for a very long time which means that they may at some point eventually access the data but other security measures can be put into place to see if someone is attempting to access the data and they can then let the authorities take over after this point.</p>
                <p>Another method is using access controls and firewalls. Access controls will add a layer of protection from the data as it acts a locked door that only one person has the key to but it can still be located and used to access the network by a hacker which is where firewalls will take place to monitor and manage access to the main or 
                    core data network from the Internet and portable devices such as phones and laptops.</p>
